A power plant as a city. A city as a power plant. An autonomous system. A model for the future.

721 spheres, vessels, containers, storage units, batteries describe a segment of a virtual over-sphere, forming the city, the system, the model.

721 mirrored spherical surfaces transform the city into a power plant that multiplies and amplifies energy.

721 pipes of varying lengths distance the 721 spheres from the base. A vaulted space is created. Energycity can be built.
