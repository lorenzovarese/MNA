The third Bauhof high-rise aims to integrate with the structure of the two existing high-rises, both from the level of Bodenackerstrasse and as part of an ensemble within the urban context. This new high-rise is envisioned as an entrance gateway from Bodenackerstrasse to the upper level at Gubelstrasse.
The core, which includes a double-helix staircase and two elevators, supports all the upper standard floors like the trunk of a tree bearing its crown.
As both Messe Schweiz and the Hallenstadion are located near Zurich-Oerlikon Airport, this third Bauhof high-rise with 133 rooms is intended to function as a hotel.
