The new age and nursing home Da Casa Val Lumnezia in Vella is designed to fit the rural context and village structure. The building, resembling a large alpine barn, is strategically positioned to create distinct outdoor spaces and mark a new village boundary. It features two offset volumes, providing depth and complexity. The three-story structure has a public character, with dedicated sections for services and dementia care, adaptable for future expansions. Constructed mainly from local wood, the design emphasizes sustainability and local craftsmanship, combining functional architecture with community engagement and flexibility for evolving needs.
