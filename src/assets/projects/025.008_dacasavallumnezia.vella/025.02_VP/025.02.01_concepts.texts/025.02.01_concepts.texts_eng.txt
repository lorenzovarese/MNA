Designing the new age and nursing home Da Casa Val Lumnezia in Vella meant engaging with the rural context of the valley’s inhabitants on one hand, and connecting a new building of considerable size and significance to the existing village structure of Vella on the other.
URBAN PLANNING CONCEPT Like a large alpine farming building, the new age and nursing home is oriented on the site from northwest to southeast, with its gable end facing outwards, thus clearly indicating its elongated orientation towards the vastness of the landscape and reflecting its importance throughout the entire valley. At the same time, it marks a new boundary for the village of Vella. This positioning of the building volume creates two distinctly characterized outdoor spaces. To the northwest lies the lively arrival and meeting area, shaped by village structures. This includes the paved forecourt with evening sun, the access road for visitors and deliveries, and the parking spaces. Towards the southwest, facing the sun and the landscape, a meadow-like hollow with shade-giving fruit trees spreads out. This south side is defined by a free path leading the most agile residents up to a small culmination point. From there, one can enjoy an unobstructed view of the village and the entire valley.
DESIGN CONCEPT / ARCHITECTURAL EXPRESSION The building consists of two simple, barn-like volumes that are offset in depth by about two-thirds and longitudinally by around twelve meters. This allows for the desired depth while reducing the longitudinal extension. At the same time, the "merging" of these two typologically conventional building forms creates a new, more complex structure. Due to the offset at the northwestern end of the building, the main entrance emerges naturally. Vertically, the building is structured by a minimal horizontal offset in the external wood slat cladding, indicating the three floors behind it. This elevates the building’s status, transitioning it from a barn to a significant building with a public character.
Inside, the building is divided into three longitudinal sections. The two outer layers face the light and the views. Here, the rooms are located on the attic and upper floors. The central layer, the intersection, serves as a service layer on the ground floor (GF), as a service layer with generous openings for communal spaces on the upper floor (UF), and finally, on the attic floor (AF), as an open, enclosed courtyard between the two gables—the protected garden for dementia patients.
ACCESS / USAGE CONCEPT / OPERATIONS The choice to distribute the required program over three floors instead of four is based on urban planning (scale of the building in context) and design reasons (tectonic division of the building into three parts), but also on the intention to give each floor a distinct identity. Visitors enter the building through the main entrance, pass the hair salon, and see a green landscape ahead; on the left side along the south facade, the public zone around the cafeteria unfolds up to the terrace. One of the access cores, located at both ends of the building, leads to the AF, where the dementia ward is located, separated from the other groups. The view extends through the protected roof garden into the light-flooded access system. Each of the two care floors is divided into three groups. In the AF, the structural system offers, as an alternative to the required expansion of nine additional dementia beds (9 + 9), an expansion of only six dementia beds (9 + 6), or an additional expansion of nine more beds (9 + 6 + 9), up to an entire dementia floor (9 + 6 + 9 + 4). The three remaining groups are located on the UF. Unlike the AF, there are two group rooms in the center of the building that can be combined into a generous ward room, illuminated by two large and diagonally opposite loggias and some skylights. At the two ends of the building are two smaller group living rooms with surprising views. Here too, several different configurations are possible due to the strategically clever positioning of the ward rooms and group living rooms. The vertical circulation and emergency escape routes are optimally ensured with the access cores located at the two ends of the "merged" building. We believe this adaptability leads to sustainable operations in the medium to long term, with a high degree of flexibility in adapting the structure to future developments.
CONSTRUCTION / MATERIALIZATION / ECONOMY Except for the basement and the two access cores, which are made of in-situ concrete, the building is a complete wooden structure made from prefabricated wooden frame elements. The principle is to build a house entirely from local wood stocks, prefabricated in local woodworking shops, and assembled on site. A house built by locals for locals. This choice is based on architectural-contextual, local trade, and construction process considerations. A distinctive decision is to use the inner wooden panel of the frame as a visible and finishing panel in the publicly accessible rooms (group rooms, access corridors, and cafeteria area), possibly only glazing it with a hint of white pigmentation. The facade is also made of wood. It is constructed from a ventilated vertical larch board cladding (six to ten centimeters wide).
