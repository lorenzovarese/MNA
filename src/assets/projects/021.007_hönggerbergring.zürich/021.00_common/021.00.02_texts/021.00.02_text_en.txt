The project features a striking glass structure known as the "Visitor Platform," located behind the Hönggenberg and visible from the A1 motorway, acting as a visual magnet on the horizon. The platform's roof is supported by four diagonally braced steel trusses, and its floor slab is suspended by steel cables connected through a concrete core and a glassed inner courtyard. The platform includes multiple open spaces such as a reception, Science Club Bar and Lounge, banquet halls, and both served and self-service restaurants.

Adjacent to this is the "Academic Guest House," which hosts 20 hotel rooms and 12 apartments. The guest house is designed to complement the Visitor Platform by maintaining a discreet presence behind intersecting steel braces, providing an intimate and elegant environment for guests. It features white enameled steel frame windows and prefabricated concrete panels, with a rooftop terrace offering a 360° view of the Zurich panorama. The structure comprises steel columns and beams, and is naturally ventilated, housing offices and building services in its renovated base. The services are routed through a concrete core from the guest house to the Visitor Platform.
